2.1

  * Fixed efficiency bug introduced with syntax highlighting: ne should now
    be much more responsive along slow connections.

  * Fixed old, bad, shameful bug: complex assertions were compiled into
    the code even for the non-debug version. As a result, ne was deadly
    slow on large files.

  * Fixed small mistakes in the keyboard sequences displayed in the menus,
    and small discrepancies between default.keys/default.menus and reality
    (thanks to John Gabriele for having pointed out this).

  * In some cases after a keyboard timeout an ESC character was left in
    the keyboard buffer, causing weird behaviours.

  * Probably really (this time) fixed problems with regexps matching empty strings.

  * BackSpace and Delete behave better in FreeForm mode.

  * Fixed memory allocation macros in regex code from glibc to work on systems
    which return NULL on zero-sized allocations.

  * In makefile, made explicit the dependancies for regex.o.

  * Mention http://groups.google.com/group/niceeditor in splash screen.

  * About now displays splash screen in addition to its status bar message.

  * Added AutoMatchBracket to indicate visible matching {}, (), [], <> pairs.

  * Fixed bug in "AdjustView R" that could push current character of screen.

  * Ensure tab size remains less than half the window width when the window
    changes size.
