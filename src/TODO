- Senza status bar errori di aggiornamento video
- non si INVERSE-ano i caratteri speciali

I've noticed a difference (yet another difference) between xterm and gnome
terminal. If you cursor down to the bottom of the screen so that the page
starts to scroll up, the status bar updates in xterm as the page scrolls,
but not in gnome terminal. Again, I stared at some source files waiting
for enlightenment, but nothing happened. Just thought I'd mention it...

Fix the DNW/DPW stuff

- Control chars are displayed incorrectly on the command line
- Check resize on a Mac
- Open files > 2G.

- Large line numbers create overflows in the computatio of the percentage
