0) Garbage collection. Under some extreme circumstances
   in which the number of lost characters is
   intolerably high, ne should allocate a new block of
   memory and move contiguously the text into it.

1) Fast large copying. When one pastes a *very large*
   clip, we should create a pool entry just for that
   copy and copy contiguously in it, instead of
   allocating line by line.

2) Moving to C99:

   - aggressively const'ing whatever can be const'd.
   - bool type for all bools (and false/true instead of FALSE/TRUE).
   - loop variables declared inside loops to reduce lexical scoping.
   - More generally, reduce lexical scoping: no variables at the
     start of a function, locally declared const's for temporary values, etc.
   - all variables containing attributes uint32_t.
   - all variables containing lines, columns, positions uint64_t.
   - checking that we never mix 32 and 64 bit integers in the 
     wrong way (e.g., 32-bit counter and 64-bit upper bound in 
     loops, or loss of precision).
