- Open files > 2G.

- Increase coverage.

0) Garbage collection. Under some extreme circumstances
   in which the number of lost characters is
   intolerably high, ne should allocate a new block of
   memory and move contiguously the text into it.

1) Fast large copying. When one pastes a *very large*
   clip, we should create a pool entry just for that
   copy and copy contiguously in it, instead of
   allocating line by line.

2) Loading from pipes. We should be able to read files
   in which the length is not known. I think the best
   thing to do would be to allocate exponentially
   larger pools starting with the default size.
